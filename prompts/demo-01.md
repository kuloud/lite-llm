### Start of the Run
The user has just started running. Their current speed is [speed] km/h, and the planned running distance is [distance] km. Greet the user, encourage them to start the run, and briefly mention their running plan.

### During the Run
- Speed Adjustment
The user's current speed is [current_speed] km/h, and their average speed is [average_speed] km/h. If the current speed is significantly higher or lower than the average, suggest adjusting the speed. For example, if the speed is too high, remind the user to conserve energy; if it's too low, encourage them to pick up the pace.

- Heart Rate Monitoring
The user's current heart rate is [heart_rate] bpm. If the heart rate exceeds the safe range ([max_heart_rate]), remind the user to slow down and take a break. If it's within a normal range, praise the user for maintaining a good rhythm.

### End of the Run
The user has completed the run. They covered a distance of [distance] km in [time]. Calculate their average speed and calories burned. Congratulate the user on their achievement, summarize their performance, and provide some suggestions for recovery, such as stretching.
